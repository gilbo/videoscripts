These are a couple of disorganized scripts that were originally created for processing the UIST 2015 videos.

These are not particularly well organized or generalized scripts, but they do implicitly contain knowledge gained from fighting with ffmpeg settings for hours on end.  Please contact Gilbert for assistance if you find yourself getting stuck.  There's some chance he might recognize your problem.

It would also be nice to clean this stuff up into a more robust set of tools eventually.
